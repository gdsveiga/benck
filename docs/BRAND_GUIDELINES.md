## Brand Overview

**Benck** is a technology company that specializes in creating fully customized CRM and ERP solutions for small and medium-sized businesses. Unlike generic, one-size-fits-all software, Benck builds applications tailored to each client's unique workflows, processes, and needs.

**What We Do:**
- Custom CRM development
- Custom ERP solutions
- Business process automation
- Internal workflow optimization
- Ongoing support and iteration

**Our Promise:**
We don't force your business to adapt to software—we build software that adapts to your business.

## Brand Story

The name **Benck** has a personal origin. It comes from the names of the founders' two dogs: **Zack** and **Bento**. This might seem unconventional for a tech company, but it reflects something important about who we are: we're real people who care about the things (and beings) that matter to us.

This personal touch extends to how we work with clients. We're not a faceless corporation. We're a team that takes the time to understand your business, your challenges, and your goals—just like we take the time to understand what makes Zack and Bento happy.

The period in **Benck.** represents completeness and confidence. It's a statement, not a question. When you work with Benck, you get a complete solution.

## Mission, Vision & Values

### Mission
To empower small and medium-sized businesses with custom software solutions that simplify operations, accelerate growth, and eliminate the frustration of working around generic tools.

### Core Values

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Customization First** | Every business is unique. Your software should be too. |

| **Partnership** | We're not just vendors—we're partners invested in your success. |
| **Simplicity** | Complex problems deserve elegant, simple solutions. |

## Brand Voice & Tone

### Voice Characteristics

Our brand voice is consistent across all communications:

| Characteristic | What It Means | Example |
|----------------|---------------|---------|
| **Professional** | We know our craft and communicate with expertise | "Our solutions integrate seamlessly with your existing infrastructure" |
| **Friendly** | We're approachable and human, never cold or corporate | "Let's figure this out together" |
| **Innovative** | We embrace modern solutions and forward-thinking approaches | "We build for where your business is going, not just where it is" |
| **Clear** | We avoid jargon and explain things simply | "Your data, organized and accessible" instead of "Optimized data architecture paradigms" |
| **Confident** | We stand behind our work without being arrogant | "We'll build exactly what you need" |

### Tone Adjustments by Context

| Context | Tone Adjustment |
|---------|-----------------|
| Website copy | Confident, inspiring, benefit-focused |
| Social media | Friendly, conversational, engaging |
| Client proposals | Professional, thorough, reassuring |
| Support communications | Warm, patient, solution-oriented |
| Technical documentation | Clear, precise, helpful |

### Writing Guidelines

**Do:**
- Use active voice ("We build solutions" not "Solutions are built by us")

## Typography

### Primary Typeface: Inter

**Inter** is our primary typeface. It's modern, highly legible, and works excellently across digital and print applications. It's also free and widely available.

**Alternative:** If Inter is unavailable, use **Poppins** or **Montserrat**.

### Type Hierarchy

| Element | Font | Weight | Size (Web) |
|---------|------|--------|------------|
| H1 - Headlines | Inter | Bold (700) | 48-64px |
| H2 - Section Headers | Inter | Bold (700) | 32-40px |
| H3 - Subsections | Inter | SemiBold (600) | 24-28px |
| Body Text | Inter | Regular (400) | 16-18px |
| Captions/Small | Inter | Regular (400) | 14px |
| Buttons/CTAs | Inter | SemiBold (600) | 16px |

### Typography Guidelines

- Use **bold weights** for headlines to create impact
- Maintain comfortable line heights (1.5 for body text)
- Left-align body text; center headlines sparingly
- Use sentence case for headlines ("Build your perfect CRM")
- Avoid all caps except for small labels or buttons
